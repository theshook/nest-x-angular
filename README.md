✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Requirements
- Node.js `v20.9.0` or higher
- Nx CLI (Optional)
- Angular CLI (Optional)
- NestJS CLI (Optional)
- MongoDB

## Start the API

Run `npx nx serve api` to start the development server. Happy coding!

## Start the Web App

Run `npx nx serve web` to start the development server. Happy coding!

## Build for production

Run `npx nx build api` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

running all projects with a specific target. This will start `api` and `web` project

```
npx nx run-many -t serve
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).
